A dynamic programming approach solution to calculate the minimum cost of transfer to transfer all the disks from one tower to another tower.


The Tower of Hanoi also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at top, thus making a conical shape.
The puzzle can be with any number of disks, although many toy versions have around seven to nine of them. The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n-1, where n is the number of disks.

Applications:
1.	The Tower of Hanoi is frequently used in psychological research on problem solving.
2.	It is also used as a Backup rotation scheme when performing computer data Backups where multiple tapes/media are involved.
3.	Tower of Hanoi is popular for teaching recursive algorithms to beginning programming students.
4.	The Tower of Hanoi is also used as a test by neuropsychologists trying to evaluate frontal lobe deficits.

This program uses recursion to show the movement of disk from one tower to another.
